HOWTO
-----
This file presents instructions to use the analysis framework on root files with old and new structure.


If you need to work on both new reconstructed files and old reconstructed files, you can keep two versions of NA62Analysis.
old one at: /path/to/old/framework  (use svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/na62fw/trunk/NA62Analysis -r 656 to extract latest version able to read old files)
new one at: /path/to/new/framework

To switch between old framework and new framework, modify your scripts/env.(c)sh to have twice the export ANALYSISFW_PATH. One pointing to the old version and one pointing to the new one.
export ANALYSISFW_PATH=/path/to/old/framework
export ANALYSISFW_PATH=/path/to/new/framework

If you want to use the old one, comment out the second line. Then run
source scripts/env.sh
NA62AnalysisBuilder.py cleanuser
NA62AnalysisBuilder.py your-config-file

If you want to switch to the new one, comment out the first line. Then run
source scripts/env.sh
NA62AnalysisBuilder.py cleanuser
NA62AnalysisBuilder.py your-config-file
